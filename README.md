# Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - ML + XAI

Starter repo scaffold. Follow project doc for full pipeline. This repo is intentionally lightweight: raw data is excluded from Git. Place raw CSVs into `data/raw/`.

## Quick start (Step 1)
1. Create Python env (see docs).
2. Copy raw CSVs to `data/raw/`.
3. Run preprocessing scripts in `scripts/`.

(Full pipeline and training instructions in /docs.)
